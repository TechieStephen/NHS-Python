#CONDITIONALS IN PYTHON
'''
Python has two primitive loop commands:
-- while loops
-- for loops
'''

#WHILE LOOP
'''
While Loop is a structure in python which allows
us to loop through and execute a piece of code multiple times
until a certain condition is false


///Code
x = 1

while x <= 10:
    print(x)
    x = x+1 #short hand version x += 1

print("DONE")
///

--------------------------------------
Note: remember to increment x, or else the loop will 
continue forever. And you will get an infinite loop
