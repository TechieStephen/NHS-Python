A tuple is a data structure (a container) for storing
different values. it is more like a list but it has
some few key differences from list.

HOW TO CREATE A TUPLE
///code
coordinates = (4, 5)
///

a unique feature about tuple is that they are immutable
this means that once created a tuple can't be changed or
modified. its more like a WYSIWYG

READ ElEMENT / ATTRIBUTES FROM A TUPLE
///code
print(coordinates[1])
///

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TUPLE AND A LIST
-- tuples use parenthesis while a list uses square
   brackets
-- you can mutate a list but you can't mutate a tuple

-------------------
so basically in most use cases you use tuples
for collection of data that is never going to change.

you are probably going to be using lists more
